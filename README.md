# Token-Sorting
A Java Program to break data inputted from files into tokens and sorting them based on their frequencies 

Here we break the data taken from the '.txt' file into tokens and we sort them using 2 different methods of sorting maps (As we use map here).
This code will also print the time taken to sort the list of tokens.
A file has to be created with some data in it to get the tokens and the location of that file should be properly entered in the program.

Limitation : This code is limited for a single sentence or paragraph. It should not contain any nextLined(Enter pressed) sentence. Because it will misbehave and will give wrong output.

Any queries/doubts regarding the code?
Feel free to ping me up anytime. I will try to get it resolved as soon as possible.
